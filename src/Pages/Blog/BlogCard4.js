            React offers a Getting Started guide that should help one set up
            React in about an hour. The documentation is thorough and complete,
            with solutions to common issues already present on Stack Overflow.
            React is not a complete framework and advanced features require the
            use of third-party libraries. This makes the learning curve of the
            core framework not so steep but depends on the path you take with
            additional functionality. However, learning to use React does not
            necessarily mean that you are using the best practices.
