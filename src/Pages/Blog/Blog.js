              What are the different ways to manage state in a React
              application?

              In React apps, there are at least seven ways to handle the state.
              Let us briefly explore a few of them in this part.

              How does prototypical inheritance work?
            </h3>
            <p className="mt-2 text-justify">
              Every object with its methods and properties contains an internal
              and hidden property known as [[Prototype]]. The Prototypal
              Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add methods and
              properties in objects. It is a method by which an object can
              inherit the properties and methods of another object.
              Traditionally, in order to get and set the [[Prototype]] of an
              object, we use Object.getPrototypeOf and Object.setPrototypeOf.
              Nowadays, in modern language, it is being set using __proto__.

              What is a unit test? Why should we write unit tests?
            </h3>
            <p className="mt-2 text-justify">
              The main objective of unit testing is to isolate written code to
              test and determine if it works as intended. Unit testing is an
              important step in the development process, because if done
              correctly, it can help detect early flaws in code which may be
              more difficult to find in later testing stages.
              <br />
              <br />
              Unit tests save time and money. Usually, we tend to test the happy
              path more than the unhappy path. If you release such an app
              without thorough testing, you would have to keep fixing issues
              raised by your potential users. The time to fix these issues
              couldâ€™ve been used to build new features or optimize the existing
              system. Bear in mind that fixing bugs without running tests could
              also introduce new bugs into the system.

              React vs Angular vs Vue?
            </h3>
            <p className="mt-2 text-justify">
              React offers a Getting Started guide that should help one set up
              React in about an hour. The documentation is thorough and
              complete, with solutions to common issues already present on Stack
              Overflow. React is not a complete framework and advanced features
              require the use of third-party libraries. This makes the learning
              curve of the core framework not so steep but depends on the path
              you take with additional functionality. However, learning to use
              React does not necessarily mean that you are using the best
              practices.
